Code or software used to generate results or presented in the manuscript must be open-source. Include in the manuscript the Computer Code Availability section that lists at least: 1) Name and version of the code developed or used, 2) the license(s) type (https://opensource.org/licenses), and 3) a link to a public repository (mandatory) where the code and its license document can be accessed anonymously (for example a git repository, please don't put the source code directly in the manuscript, don't use a link to a personal website or file-sharing service). Refer to the guide for authors for more information. In case no code was developed or used for the research described in the manuscript, include the following declaration in the following text boxes: "No code or software has been developed for this research.". Please put the same sentence in the Computer Code Availability section in the manuscript (mandatory section). The use of non-open-source code or proprietary software is not accepted. Scripts that run inside proprietary execution environments (e.g., MATLAB) need to be made available as open source code and are accepted.
